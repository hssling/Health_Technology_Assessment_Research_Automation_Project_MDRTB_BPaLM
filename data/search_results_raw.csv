41173129,Mutations in gyrA and gyrB among drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in South Korea.,"Group A fluoroquinolones (FLQs) are essential for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Mutations in gyrA and gyrB cause FLQ resistance, but their patterns vary by region. This study evaluated FLQ-associated mutations in the gyrA and gyrB genes by analyzing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using 7H9 broth microdilution (BMD) and Löwenstein-Jensen phenotypic drug susceptibility test (L-J pDST).",2025,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",10.1016/j.meegid.2025.105849,Seungmo Kim; Hwi-Jun Kim; Ryeun Heo; Hyeon-Su Kim; Jong-Myun Song; Cheon-Tae Kim; Hee-Jin Kim; Soul-Hee Kim; Jeong-Hui Gwon; Gicheon Bae; Sumi Kang; Kwang-Hyuk Seok; Eunseon Kim; Dae-Seon Han; Mi-So Kim; Hyeon-Ju Lee; Seonmi Shin; Arim Song; Gyeong In Lee; Seung-Heon Lee; Hyejin Kim; Orena Beatrice; Jane Babirye; Ocung Guido; Mary Akumu; Hee Joo Lee
41172775,A POC label-free biosensor to detect point mutations in the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from RR-TB raw sputum samples.,"Rifampicin-resistant and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB) remain pressing global health concerns. Conventional diagnostics such as culture and GeneXpert are limited by high cost, infrastructure requirements, and lengthy procedures, highlighting the need for rapid and reliable molecular detection platforms. We developed an electrochemical biosensor for the selective detection of wild-type and clinically relevant point mutations (codons 516 and 531) in the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thiolated gene-specific ssDNA probes were immobilized on gold nanoparticle-modified carbon screen-printed electrodes. The working principle of the designed biosensor relies on hybridization between the immobilized ssDNA probes and their complementary target sequences, which induces a marked decrease in electrochemical signals measured using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV), thereby confirming high mutation specificity. The biosensor achieved detection limits of 6.01 pM and 6.48 pM for codons 516 and 531, respectively, with strong linearity (R",2025,"Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",10.1016/j.bioelechem.2025.109138,Muhammad Nauman Sharif; Saman Taufiq; Manzar Sohail; Shah Rukh Abbas
41170472,Consolidation of a genomic epidemiological surveillance network for tuberculosis (REVIGET) in northern and northeastern Brazil: a study protocol.,"Globally, tuberculosis (TB) remains a top cause of death from infectious diseases, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths annually. Given its substantial social and economic burden, TB is a priority in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The WHO's End TB Strategy emphasizes research, innovation, and the rapid implementation of new technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which are pivotal for precision health approaches and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) surveillance. This study aims to strengthen genomic TB surveillance in the North and Northeast Brazilian regions by applying WGS to study DR-TB cases, training professionals in genomics and bioinformatics, and deploying a national surveillance platform (GEMIBRA). This is an observational, cross-sectional, prospective, quantitative, and qualitative study to be conducted in the states of Pará, Amazonas, Ceará, and Bahia.

41170421,,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a persistent global public health challenge, with the rise of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) complicating all the disease control efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advocated for molecular diagnostic techniques, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to enhance TB diagnosis and treatment strategies. In this study, we performed WGS analysis on 49 pulmonary tuberculosis isolates from Mexican patients to identify mutations conferring resistance to 11 key antimicrobial agents: four first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) and 7 second line drugs (fluoroquinolones, ethionamide/prothionamide, amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, streptomycin, and bedaquiline). We identified 89 novel variants: 48 in genes previously associated with drug resistance and 41 in genes not previously linked to resistance mechanisms, including potential novel mutations associated with delamanid resistance. Additionally, we detected 31 mutations across three efflux pump superfamilies (ABC, RND, and MFS); all of these variants warrant further investigation regarding their contribution to antibiotic resistance. This analysis represents approximately 10% of Mexico's national variant registry, providing substantial insight into the molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis within the country. The identification of new resistance-associated variants (RAV) from clinical isolates underrepresented in global databases, contributes to develop improved diagnostic tools, optimize treatment regimens, and probably to elucidate antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Specifically, the identification of RAVs for new drugs like bedaquiline, pretomanid, delamanid, and linezolid, which are central to the most recent schemes of treatment (BPaLM, BPaL, BDLLfxC, BLMZ), is key to the improvement of patient outcomes and preventing the emergence of resistance to these critical therapeutic options.",2025,Frontiers in microbiology,10.3389/fmicb.2025.1666838,Néstor Alvarado-Peña; Marcela Muñoz Torrico; Luis Narváez-Díaz; Paulina M Mejía-Ponce; Eduardo Becerril Vargas; Joaquín Zúñiga; Raquel Muñiz-Salazar; Rafael Laniado-Laborín; Cuauhtémoc Licona-Cassani; Xavier Soberón; Eugenia Silva-Herzog
41168684,"Key resistance-associated mutations in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a genomic study from Shanghai, China, with a focus on aminoglycosides.","The aminoglycosides are essential drugs in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Antibiotic resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major public health concern worldwide. Therefore, it is of great significance to characterize the mutations by which susceptible M. tuberculosis evolves into drug resistance. A total of 110 clinical isolates of MDR-TB were used for Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing to aminoglycosides, including amikacin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. Among 110 clinical MDR-TB strains, 7 (6.36%) were cross-resistant to amikacin and kanamycin, and 81 (73.64%) were resistant to streptomycin. The resistance rates to rifabutin, streptomycin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, and ethambutol were observed in 79.09%, 73.64%,35.45%, 34.55%, and 30.91%, respectively. Among the 81 MDR-TB strains resistant to streptomycin, the MIC values of streptomycin against MDR-TB showed the following distribution: 61 strains (75.31%) demonstrated resistance with MICs ≥ 32 µg/ml. The rrs gene mutations were detected in 6 (85.71%; 6/7) of the amikacin/kanamycin-resistant isolates, with the most frequent mutation being A1401G. Mutations in the eis promoter were identified at two positions in 3 amikacin/kanamycin-susceptible and streptomycin-resistant isolates (-10G > A and - 37G > T). In 80.25% (65 out of 81) of streptomycin-resistant MDR-TB isolates, two types of amino acid substitutions associated with rpsL mutations were identified. K43R was observed in 86.15% of isolates with mutations in rpsL, followed by K88R at 13.85%. In conclusion, current critical concentration methods and the design of molecular diagnostics need to be revisited to provide more accurate assessments of streptomycin resistance for rspL mutation-bearing isolates.",2025,BMC microbiology,10.1186/s12866-025-04446-x,Yinjuan Guo; Jinghui Yang; Hongxiu Wang; Wei Sha; Fangyou Yu
41168391,Diagnostic assistance method for RR-TB/MDR-TB patients under treatment based on CNN-LSTM.,"The rapid development of deep learning has promoted its application in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in the management of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis/multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB/MDR-TB). In particular, chest computed tomography (CT) scans offer detailed lung images that can reveal subtle features. In this study, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model to predict treatment outcomes in RR-TB/MDR-TB patients, aiming to support clinicians in timely adjustment of therapeutic strategies and improving treatment success. The model integrates CNN for image feature extraction with LSTM for sequential analysis of patient monitoring data, including two types of immune detection indicators (T-cell subsets and peripheral blood tuberculosis-related CD161-positive cells). Transfer learning with weight initialization was applied to enhance model performance, and three backbone architectures (DenseNet201 + ABC, ResNet-50 + ABC, CheXNet + ABC) were compared to assess their impact on predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated that the CNN-LSTM model with DenseNet201 + ABC as the backbone achieved the highest accuracy in predicting subsequent treatment indicators. These findings demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using CNN-LSTM for treatment outcome prediction in RR-TB/MDR-TB, and highlighted its potential to assist clinicians in precision-tailoring treatment plans, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and offering both theoretical and practical value in healthcare.",2025,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-21955-x,Jie Li; Wenqing Wu; Zhixiong Fang; Pinxiang Fu; Hua Huang; Yanhong Zhou; Liang Yu; He Huang; Tao Wang; Qilong Zhang

41160121,Examination of Genetic Mutations of Clofazimine Resistance in Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium TB Isolates.,"Anti-tuberculosis activity and resistance were recently refocused since clofazimine (CFZ) had a significant therapeutic benefit in treating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We investigate the resistance of CFZ and genetic mutations in drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of TB patients. CFZ range of CFZ was determined by testing 20 sensitive strains and 80 MDR clinical isolates. The correlation between the patients' treatment history and CFZ resistance was examined. PCR and DNA sequencing were employed to analyze mutations in the Rv0678, Rv1979c, and pepQ genes of CFZ-resistant and susceptible strains. Drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates had an 21.25% incidence of CFZ resistance with MIC > 1 mg/L. Neither bedaquiline nor CFZ therapy was the cause of CFZ resistance. It is necessary to perform a CFZ susceptibility test regardless of prior drug exposure. This study reported novel mutation sites associated with CFZ resistance in the pepQ (V85M/R437L/T438N and G605A/G619M/A610Q), Rv0678 (214 C→Tand 407T→C), and Rv1979c (155 A→C, 562 C→T, 1216G→A,724G→A, and 1057T→G) genes.",2025,Current microbiology,10.1007/s00284-025-04582-7,Khaoula Balgouthi; Emel Eker; Manaf AlMatar; Osman Albarri; Işil Var

41152417,Genomic characterization and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage 2 isolates from Kazakhstan.,"Kazakhstan has one of the highest incidence rates of MDR-TB in the WHO European Region. However, data on the genomic diversity of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Kazakhstan remains limited. We performed whole-genome sequencing on 177 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates belonging to the L2/Beijing lineage, sourced from 15 regions across Kazakhstan. WGS data were analyzed using the computational genomics pipelines TB-Profiler, TB-Annotator, and MTBseq. We then carried out Bayesian analyses using the BEAST algorithm to predict the effective population size dynamics of M. tuberculosis in Kazakhstan over the last 50 years. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing revealed a significant proportion of MDR (46.9%) and pre-XDR (14.7%) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 67.2% of M. tuberculosis L2/Beijing isolates belonged to the Central Asian outbreak (CAO) sublineage. Putative compensatory variants were detected in 89.6% of RIF-resistant CAO isolates, with rpoABC variants showing strong sublineage specificity. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis contributed to the identification of six novel historical clusters, each characterized by distinct SNP signatures. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated recent transmission and clonal expansion of CAO isolates. Meanwhile, Bayesian skyline analysis revealed a marked increase in the effective population size of Mtb. This study used genomic characterization to show that the CAO sublineage of M. tuberculosis lineage 2 has been highly successful during the MDR-TB epidemic in Kazakhstan, which has coincided with major economic fluctuations.",2025,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-22485-2,Dana Auganova; Sabina Atavliyeva; Nour Gharbi; Elena Zholdybayeva; Yuri Skiba; Akmaral Akisheva; Anna Tsepke; Arike Alenova; Christophe Guyeux; Thierry Wirth; Christophe Sola; Pavel Tarlykov

Treatment planning becomes even more complex when psychiatric comorbidities and drug hypersensitivities further limit the therapeutic arsenal. This case describes a 41-year-old man with a history of prior incarceration and incompletely treated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, who presented with pulmonary symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with XDR-TB. Drug susceptibility testing revealed extensive resistance, including to bedaquiline, clofazimine, and moxifloxacin. A pre-existing mood disorder necessitated the avoidance of neurotoxic agents such as cycloserine, and allergic reactions to several antibiotics led to further regimen modifications. This case underscores the clinical difficulty of managing XDR-TB in the setting of psychiatric illness and drug intolerance. A multidisciplinary, individualized approach was crucial in designing a regimen that strikes a balance between antimicrobial effectiveness and mental health considerations.

41146348,Critical appraisal of progress and challenges in tuberculosis preventive treatment in the Western Pacific Region: a situational analysis of seven high tuberculosis burden countries.,"We commend Oh et al.'s recent analysis of TB preventive treatment (TPT) in the Western Pacific Region, but note important gaps and ways forward. We first caution that reliance on routine program data may overestimate gains. For example, China's passive surveillance misses ≈20% of cases [1]. Prospective cohorts or integrated surveillance including clinical databases could validate coverage estimates. We also urge attention to overlooked risk groups beyond children and PLHIV (as highlighted by Oh et al. [2]), groups like healthcare workers, prisoners, and people with diabetes warrant targeted TPT pilots (e.g., occupational health or prison-based programs). In the Philippines, ~ 36% of TB patients first seek private care [3], so partnering with private clinics and pharmacies is essential to reach all contacts. Likewise, MDR-TB contacts were underemphasized; WHO now strongly recommends a 6-month levofloxacin regimen for MDR contacts [4]. We encourage pilot studies of this regimen (as in Mongolia [5]) and operational research on MDR-TPT. Finally, policy does not guarantee practice as Cambodia and Lao PDR have guidelines, yet stockouts and training gaps persist [6, 7]. Embedding TPT in universal health insurance and conducting cost effectiveness studies will support sustainable scale-up. In sum, by suggesting concrete examples and research strategies for each country, we aim to refine Oh et al.'s insights into actionable steps for TPT acceleration.",2025,Tropical medicine and health,10.1186/s41182-025-00840-3,Muhamad Khizar; Ehsanullah Alokozay; Muhammad Junaid; Najibullah Alokozay

41126479,Dectin-1 (CLEC-7A) and Mincle (CLEC-4E) suppress protective responses of macrophages during Mycobacterial infection.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB is responsible for extreme mortality and morbidity across the globe. The bacteria have evolved multiple strategies for their successful prevalence. The emergence of MDR-TB has established the importance of eliciting host-pathogen interactions at cellular and molecular levels. Various pattern recognition receptors play determinant roles when encountering M. tb infection. Here we investigated the regulation of key defense responses from Dectin-1 and Mincle during mycobacterial infection in THP-1 derived macrophages, the long-term hosts for mycobacteria. Our data indicate that infection of THP-1 macrophages with either M. bovis BCG or M. tb H37Rv increases the surface expression of Dectin-1 and Mincle. This increase translated directly to increased intracellular bacterial survival within macrophages. Likewise, M. bovis BCG infection of human PBMC derived macrophages also led to an increased expression of Dectin-1 and Mincle. Stimulation of Dectin-1 or Mincle along with BCG infection induces suppressor responses such as an attenuated oxidative burst and mitochondrial membrane potential intactness. In addition, decreased apoptosis and autophagy induction was also observed following stimulation of Dectin-1 and Mincle. Conversely, RNAi mediated knockdown of Dectin-1 or Mincle reversed the above responses resulting in higher oxidative burst, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and increased apoptosis. This results in a significant decrease in intracellular mycobacterial survival. These results point towards a well-orchestrated strategy of fine-tuning host's defense machinery of Dectin-1 and Mincle adopted by mycobacteria to suppress protective responses mounted against it and prepare the macrophages for prolonged persistent infection.",2025,Journal of leukocyte biology,10.1093/jleuko/qiaf146,Akshita Singh; Aarti Singh; Vishal Sinha; Ankush K Rana; Shakuntala S K Saraswati; Aayushi Singh; Kanika Kalra; Sunil Thakur; Dhiraj Kumar; Krishnamurthy Natarajan

41120609,Incidence and predictors of mortality among persons with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and HIV in Mozambique.,"Rifampicin-Resistant Tuberculosis (RRTB) is associated with a high risk of mortality during treatment. This study aims to describe the baseline characteristics associated with incidence of mortality in persons with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (P-RRTB) in a rural setting in Mozambique. We analyzed cohort data collected retrospectively from paper medical files and electronic medical records of P-RRTB who were routinely treated at Carmelo Hospital of Chokwe (Gaza province, Mozambique), from 1st January 2015 to 31st December 2020. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and adjusted Cox regression analyses were used to model the time to death and associated factors of mortality. Overall, 151 P-RRTB contributed to a total number of 1812 person-months (PM) of treatment follow-up. The overall mortality rate was 1.9 per 100 person-months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.1). Adjusted Cox regression predicted higher risk of mortality in those treated with injectable anti-RRTB second line drugs (SLD), (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.72, 95% CI 1.23-11.22, p = 0.020), had a parenchymal lesion with more than 50% fibrosis (aHR 3.06, 95% CI 1.38-6.79, p = 0.006), presented right ventricular dysfunction on the echocardiogram with venous assessment (aHR 3.18, 95% CI 1.15-8.83, p = 0.026), and manifested baseline hemoglobin (Hgb) = 8.0-9.9 g/dL (aHR 2.82, 95% CI 1.09-7.27, p = 0.032), as well Hgb < 7.9 g/dL (aHR 3.06, 95%CI 1.24-7 0.51, p = 0.015). However, lower risk of mortality was predicted in those who had an optimal immunovirological response to ART (aHR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.93, p = 0.040). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher cumulative incidence of mortality after 3 months of follow-up, above 26% in those with immunovirological failure to ART therapy (p = 0.006), 45% with Hgb < 7.9 g/dL (p < 0.001), 23% in treated with injectables-based drugs (p = 0.03), 39% with parenchymal lesion > 50% fibrosis on the chest X-ray (p < 0.001), 56% with right ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.003). Mortality risk among P-RRTB was higher in those with anemia, injectable anti-RRTB medications, lung lesions > 50% fibrosis, and right ventricular dysfunction.",2025,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-20658-7,Edy Nacarapa; Benedita Jose; Isabelle Munyangaju; Dulce Osório; Jose-Manuel Ramos-Rincon

41118340,Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of cycloserine/terizidone and clofazimine in patients with pulmonary TB.,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) treatment outcomes are poor, partly due to suboptimal drug penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Little is known about the CSF pharmacokinetics of many TB drugs, both established and new. This study investigated the CSF penetration of cycloserine (administered as terizidone) and clofazimine, two core second-line drugs for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). We recruited participants with pulmonary drug-resistant TB, but without TBM, receiving terizidone and/or clofazimine for at least 2 weeks and collected serial plasma samples and a single CSF sample. Drug concentrations were quantified with validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis, and population pharmacokinetic modeling was used to estimate the partition coefficient and equilibration half-life. Data were available from 27 participants, with a median age of 36 (range 20-60) and a weight of 52 kg (30-73 kg), who contributed 216 plasma and 27 CSF samples. The plasma pharmacokinetics of both drugs was in line with previous reports. Terizidone, measured as cycloserine, achieved CSF exposure of 69% relative to plasma, with plasma and CSF concentrations equilibrating with a half-life of 4.7 hours. Clofazimine CSF penetration was 0.13% of plasma exposure, with an equilibration half-life of 55.4 hours. Cycloserine and clofazimine concentrations in CSF approximated their estimated unbound (active) concentration in plasma, thus suggesting good penetration of the unbound drug into the CSF, supporting their potential use in TBM regimens. This study demonstrates a feasible and reproducible method for effective assessment of CSF drug penetration for CNS infections.",2025,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,10.1128/aac.00931-25,Caryn M Upton; Jose M Calderin; Andreas H Diacon; Martin J Boeree; Paolo Denti; Lubbe Wiesner; Tracy Kellermann; Megan McCulloch; Rob Aarnoutse
41116166,Immunotherapy for tuberculosis: current strategies and future directions.,"The worldwide dissemination of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) presents significant obstacles to conventional anti-TB treatment and prevention methods based on bactericidal antimicrobial drugs, greatly impeding advancements in combating this most lethal disease. With growing insights into the immunopathogenesis of TB, we are increasingly recognizing the potential of immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at targeting the host. After invading the host, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) induces host cell exhaustion through its own molecules, such as early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and di-O-acyl-trehalose, manifested as suppressed proliferative capacity, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity, thereby triggering the onset of TB. In response to this pathogenic mechanism, immunotherapeutic strategies, including cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been developed to promote cytokine production, activate immune cells to exhibit anti-TB activities such as autophagy, and restore immune homeostasis, including the balance between T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 responses. These approaches have shown promise in restoring host immunity and demonstrating therapeutic effects against TB. However, a comprehensive evaluation of factors such as drug safety, optimal treatment duration, and others, is essential before these strategies can be integrated into routine clinical TB management. The advancement of immunotherapy has the potential to revolutionize current TB management and provide further benefits to patients. This review aims to comprehensively explore the advancements in diverse TB immunotherapeutic strategies, including efficacy, safety, and administration methods, and to explore the challenges and prospects of TB immunotherapy.",2025,Military Medical Research,10.1186/s40779-025-00655-7,Meng-Yuan Lyu; Hong-Li Lai; Hao-Ran Peng; Han Luo; Jian Zhou; Wan-An-Qi Ma; Chun-Ying Zhang; Hong-Xia Ruan; Yang Liu; Jie Chen; Bin-Wu Ying

41102315,Machine learning identifies MiRNA biomarkers and immune mechanisms in active tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major global public health threat. The rising prevalence of HIV/TB co-infection and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has further intensified this challenge. This study aims to explore the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the immune response to Mtb infection and to identify potential miRNA biomarkers for active TB diagnosis using machine learning techniques. miRNA expression profiles were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE70425). Differential expression analysis between active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI) patients was conducted using the ""limma"" package, with a screening threshold of |logFC| > 0.25 and p-value < 0.05. Key differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were further refined using machine learning algorithms, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and Boruta. TargetScan was employed to predict miRNA target genes, and a regulatory network was visualized using Cytoscape. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of target mRNAs. Nine machine learning models were developed based on the selected miRNAs, and their predictive performance was assessed using metrics including AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In vitro experiments were performed using THP-1 macrophages to establish an Mtb infection model. Cells were transfected with miR-3607-3p mimics and negative controls, followed by flow cytometry for apoptosis detection, Western blot for protein expression analysis, and Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) for validation of apoptosis-related gene expression. A total of 72 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. Key miRNAs, including hsa-miR-3607-3p, hsa-miR-148b, and hsa-miR-519e, were identified through multiple machine learning methods, with hsa-miR-3607-3p emerging as the primary candidate miRNA. The nine machine learning models exhibited robust predictive performance in both the training and test sets. PPI network and functional enrichment analyses indicated that the target genes of hsa-miR-3607-3p are primarily associated with cell growth and apoptosis-related pathways. In vitro experiments further suggested that hsa-miR-3607-3p may modulate the apoptotic response of THP-1 cells to Mtb infection via a caspase-dependent mechanism. miR-3607-3p was upregulated in active TB patients and may modulate the apoptosis of THP-1 cells during Mtb infection via a caspase-dependent pathway. The mechanism of this miRNA offers preliminary insights into the immune regulation of tuberculosis. miR-3607-3p may serve as a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis and intervention of active TB; however, its clinical applicability necessitates further validation through larger sample sizes and multicenter studies.",2025,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-20112-8,Zihan Cai; Chunxiao Huang; Yuyang Zhou; Lixian Wu; Shoupeng Ding
41100518,Impact of fluoroquinolone resistance on the cost-effectiveness of empiric treatment for multidrug- or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.,"The WHO recommends the bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid (BPaL) regimen with the additional fluoroquinolone antibiotic moxifloxacin (BPaLM) for initial treatment of multidrug- or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB). However, fluoroquinolone drug susceptibility testing (DST) coverage for MDR/RR-TB is only around 55% globally, and the efficacy of moxifloxacin may be compromised in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance. We extended a previous Markov cohort model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the empirical use of BPaLM as a replacement for BPaL for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB in four high MDR/RR-TB burden countries. We obtained fluoroquinolone resistance rates in these countries from WHO surveillance data and parameterised treatment efficacy from recent trial results. We performed scenario analyses across varying fluoroquinolone resistance prevalence and performed Monte Carlo simulations to generate uncertainty intervals for our primary cost-effectiveness estimates. BPaLM incurred higher costs than BPaL but averted more disability-adjusted life years, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below 50% of each country's 2019 GDP per capita. This finding remained robust across a feasible fluoroquinolone resistance prevalence range (0-70%). In the absence of fluoroquinolone DST, empirical use of BPaLM resulted in $58 (interquartile range: $49-$73), $32 (IQR: $23-$53), $35 (IQR: $28 - $51), $174 (IQR: $161 - $209) per DALY averted in Georgia, India, the Philippines, and South Africa respectively. Our findings support the empirical use of BPaLM as a potential replacement for BPaL for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB in the absence of fluoroquinolone DST, even if fluoroquinolone resistance prevalence were to increase, reinforcing recent WHO recommendations.",2025,PLOS global public health,10.1371/journal.pgph.0005275,Chaelin Kim; Sedona Sweeney; Hojoon Sohn; Gwenan M Knight; C Finn McQuaid
